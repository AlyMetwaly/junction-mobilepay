## SpeechPay - speech user interface for making instant payments.

Project developed during Junction 2018, Espoo under Data Economics track. We participated in INNOVATE BEYOND MOBILEPAY challenge.

The market of voice assistants is increasing incredibly fast in the last years. The statistics show that 1 out of 2 US citizens will own a smart speaker by the end of 2018 and 600 million people are worlwide  using a  smart speaker weekly. The voice search recognition is meant to be the next big revolution being comparable to the smartphone one.
As all technological revolutions, the fastest implementing voice assistants and applying them to new use cases might be market dominant in the future. In particular, in the fintech sector, transactions and payments can be simplified by the use of voice assistants. 
Our approach for the MobilePay challenge is implementing a service on top of the MobilePay app to support a chatbot that interacts with the user and allows him to make financial transcations more easily. 
We have developed a chatbot to assist the user in  services that MobileApp already does, like transfers, checking the financial status or purchases.
To implement the chatbot we use Dialogflow API, a Google developer tool which incorporates Google's machine learning expertise and products such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. Dialogflow is the most widely used tool to build Actions for more than 400M+ Google Assistant devices and allows you to connect with users on your website, mobile app, the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices.
